<h2 style="color:black;">Lorem ipsum</h2>
<p style="color:black">We are heading towards a new world full of exhilarating and amazing technologies including Automation, AI (Artificial Intelligence), Augmented Reality & Robotics. In our today’s article we will talk about the amazing world of Robots.

A Robot is a programmable machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions by itself with little or no direct human control or say automatically. A Robot can also be described as any construct that automates some behavior. The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of Robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is Robotics. Robotics is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary branch of engineering which consists of Mechanical, Electronic and Computer Engineering.

Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks, and in industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans. Many aspects of robotics involve artificial intelligence; robots may be equipped with the equivalent of human senses such as vision, touch, and the ability to sense temperature. Some are even capable of simple decision making, and current robotics research is geared toward devising robots with a degree of self-sufficiency that will permit mobility and decision-making in an unstructured environment. Today’s industrial robots do not resemble human beings; a robot in human form is called an android. It’s a great branch with a good scope and applications.
